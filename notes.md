meta perspective and live demo, no specifics about databricks

there will be a 3min survey in the end, so try to remember feedback during the
talk

demonstrate transparent research process on why databricks (first google
result... and duck duck go for the browser connoisseurs out there)

questionnaire: seemed prepared, knowledgeable, interesting, choice of
topics/materials

i want to be promoted and have leverage, for personal growth and development so
answer truthfully, can swipe the results under the rug and pretend talk never
happened for promotion. bain obsesses over data which is really cool, second
day of employment i received a mail that the office score dropped slightly
etc... (btw we are hiring)

also very smart with data, not pretending or fooling themselves with
subjectivity while also being aware how data can be skewed and
misrepresentative, so its a really nice environment to be a data scientist in

decently happy at Lufthansa, but during interview with bain i realized that
working there would be truly something special so i wouldn't be here
otherwise... but i wouldn't be myself if i had no data for you :)

Bain has worked with about 2/3 of the global 500 companies.

Analyzing UFO data is usually not part of my dayjob, but since I got a little 
time to prepare this talk at work, i can say we DO analyze UFO data (it just 
didn't generate profit yet, but maybe if someone is like "i buy your analysis,
even for a euro, than we generated real revenue". it would be actually quite
funny to list it somewhere on linked.. generated 1 million, generated 1 euro)

## IDEAS: 

1. scaping Databricks site, generate word cloud and see what they focus on
    - Problem: world clouds can contain useless words

## Title/Abstract
Analyzing UFO sightings with Azure Databricks

From raw data inside a cloud storage to production ready machine learning
model. Databricks promises to do it all. Do they deliver? And how does
Databricks compare to their competitors? I share my honest experience and
insights on Databricks while doing a live demo on a very serious and practical
matter.

Who am I?

I am a Senior Associate within the data science and machine learning guild at 
Bain & Company. Prior I worked as a data scientist at Lufthansa Technik and
an engineering startup. The data science team at the startup was a one man army
and databricks helped me manage various aspects like database administration,
data engineering and machine learning.

    - Run Notebook
    - Discuss UFO insights
4. Survey and Closing Words

## Use case content:

use ufo data set because its a lot more fun than ...(boring example)
even though its not big data, all the concepts can be applied to larger data
sets and I didn't want my company to complain about my unusual spending habits
on a ...(day of the week) night. 

We usually dont get a lot of cases on UFO activity, so I was disappointed to 
find out my talk here at microsoft does not have a lot of synergy effects with 
3. why does Databricks want you to use it?
4. what does the community say?
2. google trends graphs (hadoop vs. databricks)
5. show use case
my daywork.
